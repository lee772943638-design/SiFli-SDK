# Crash Analysis Guide

## 1. Introduction

The SDK integrates tools for analyzing crash issues caused by assertions or hardfaults. To facilitate memory leak analysis, enable "Enable memory trace" under `RTOS->RT-Thread Kernel->Memory Management`.

![](../../assets/crash_analysis_mem_trace.png)

Below is the log information printed when an ASSERT occurs, showing the function and line number where the ASSERT happened, along with thread, message queue, and heap information.
```

## 2. Preparation Work
For ASSERT type crashes, the log provides a rough idea of where the issue occurred. However, for hardfaults or more complex crashes, this information may not be enough, and additional tools are needed. One method is to use a debugger to attach to the target device to inspect global variables and memory (if it's a hardfault, after attaching, you need to modify the registers with the printed SP/LR/PC to view the function call stack. For ASSERT, the function call stack can be seen without modifying the registers). However, this approach locks the target device and isn't ideal for multi-person analysis. The SDK provides the `crash_dump_analyser` tool to save and restore the crash context, enabling developers to analyze the problem on a PC without connecting to the target device.

Required tools:
- JLink debugger and JLink software package
- `_SDK_ROOT/tools/crash_dump_analyser/script_`: Scripts to save and restore the context
- `_SDK_ROOT/tools/crash_dump_analyser/simarm/t32marm.exe_`: Trace32 software tool to execute the recovery script

## 3. Saving the Context
### 3.1 Save Context Using BAT Script

#### 3.1.1 Accessing the chip's saved data via UART (currently only supports 52x and 56x)
- Open _SifliUsartServer.exe_ and click Connect. Use DBGUART to simulate Jlink (only a serial connection is required on the hardware side)
![](/assets/UsartServer.png)
- Opening the _save_ram_55x.bat_ window will invoke Jlink.exe and fill the SERVER address in _SifliUsartServer.exe_ into the Identifier.
![](/assets/Jlink_command.png)

#### 3.1.2 Access the chip's saved data through Jlink
For the 55x chip, follow these steps:
- Connect the JLink emulator to the target board
- Double-click to execute the _tools/crash_dump_analyser/script/save_ram_55x.bat_ script to read data from the target board.
- You can also do this in the command line. For example, in watch_demp, call _SDK_ROOT/tools/crash_dump_analyser/script/save_ram_55x.bat_,_$SDK_ROOT/example/watch_demo/project/eh-lb555/build_ from the SDK root directory to put the generated file into _SDK_ROOT/example/watch_demo/project/eh-lb555/build_

**Possible reasons for the failure of preserving the scene**：
- The selected method of preserving the scene does not match the executed script.

```Using the UART hardware connection method or the Jlink hardware connection method to save the on-site data can all be achieved by calling JLink.exe and then executing the corresponding Jlink commands. You can compare the contents of the files named save_ram_55x.bat, sf32lb55x.jlink, and sf32lb52x.jlink to view the differences. "ip" indicates using the ip simulation method of SifliUsartServer.exe to save the on-site data, while "usb" indicates using the uab connection method to save the on-site data with the JLink emulator. Before saving the on-site data, you can first confirm the Jlink file and Jlink commands called in the executed bat file to prevent failure in saving the on-site data due to mismatch between the commands and the actual saving method.```
![](/assets/dump_command.png)

- Has the crash program been initiated on both the primary and secondary cores

```In most cases, the secondary core is not activated. For example, in sf32lb55x.jlink, there is the line "w4 0x4004f000 1 // Switch to LCPU". However, if the program does not start the secondary core, the saved state will be lost and the operation will fail. Therefore, we need to comment out the commands issued to the secondary core to ensure the normal operation of the script.```
![](/assets/dump_select.png)

After success, the following files will be generated (depending on the content of the corresponding sf32lb55x.jlink):
- _hcpu_ram.bin_: 1Mbyte of HCPU RAM data
- _psram.bin_: 32Mbyte of PSRAM data
- _ret_ram.bin_: 64Kbyte of retention RAM data
- _hcpu_itcm.bin_: 16Kbyte of retention RAM data
- _epic_reg.bin_: EPIC register
- _ezip_reg.bin_: EZIP register
- _dsi_host_reg.bin_: DSI HOST register
- _dsi_phy_reg.bin_: DSI HOST register
- _dsi_phy_reg.bin_: DSI HOST register
- _dsi_phy_reg.bin_: DSI HOST register
- _gpio1_reg.bin_: GPIO1 register
- _gpio2_reg.bin_: GPIO2 register
- _lcpu_ram.bin_: 224Kbyte of LCPU RAM data
- _lcpu_dtcm.bin_: 16Kbyte LCPU DTCM data


### 3.2 Save the scene using the AssertDumpUart tool
This tool directly connects to the debug UART port and then executes the corresponding JLink script to save the context, without needing to simulate JLink using _SifliUsartServer.exe_.
For example, with the 52x chip:
- Open _\$SDK_ROOT/tools/crash_dump_analyser/script/AssertDumpUart.exe_.
- Set the corresponding JLink script, chip model, serial port number, baud rate, and serial device (Note: It refers to the MCU's USART device, usually UART1 for HCPU and UART4 for LCPU).
- Click export to save the context.

![](../../assets/crash_analysis_AssertDumpUsart.png)

## 4. Restoring Context
### 4.1 Restoring HCPU Context
#### Double-click to run t32marm.exe, as shown below:

![](../../assets/crash_analysis_default_view.png)

#### Click the HA button (HCPU assertion)
- Select the current chip and set the path where the exported bin files are located (ensure the path does not end with a slash), and manually place the AXF file to view the HCPU crash context.
- If some bins are missing (e.g., if some dumps don't have PSRAM), you can uncheck those.

![](../../assets/crash_analysis_load_hcpu_assertion_ui.png)

#### Click the "run_next_step" button to load
Once loaded successfully, the following crash context information is displayed:

![](../../assets/crash_analysis_hcpu_window.png)

You can switch between different windows from the Window menu.

If the window is accidentally closed, you can also enter the command below "B::" to run the wake-up process.

For example: From the information in the following picture, we can see the heapAllocation window, whose full name is _B::AREA.view heapAllocation_. We can input this command to open the corresponding window, or we can directly input _AREA.view heapAllocation_.

![](../../assets/crash_analysis_hcpu_window_select.png)

`B::v.f /l /c `The window is the function call stack of the crash site.

The heapAllocation window displays the allocation status of all heap pools in the system, including the system heap and memheap_pool:
- system heap: Pool used by `rt_malloc` and `lv_mem_alloc`.
- Various memheap_pools: Pools created with `rt_memheap_init`, allocation, and release are handled by `rt_memheap_alloc` and `rt_memheap_free`.

The fields in the allocation information list represent:
- BLOCK_ADDR: The starting address of the allocated memory block, including the management item.
- BLOCK_SIZE: The size of the allocated memory, excluding the length of the management item.
- USED: Whether it is allocated, 1 means allocated, 0 means not allocated.
- TICK: The time when the allocation occurred, in OS ticks (1 ms).
- RETURN ADDR: The address of the caller.

#### Handling Missing Crash Stack
After completing the previous 3 steps, sometimes the crash scene stack will not be displayed, possibly because the dump content was not saved or was saved incorrectly. You can try the following methods:
- 1. Load the scene stack from Jlink halt log information
  The HR (HCPU Registers) button is used to restore CPU registers that did not reach the exception handler.
  After clicking the button, select the exported _log.txt_ file, which will fill the 16 HCPU registers back into Trace32.

![](../../assets/crash_analysis_toolsbar_HR.png)


- 2. From the 16 registers printed in the log, refill them into the register window of trace32

![](../../assets/crash_analysis_restore_registers_from_log.png)


- 3. For gcc compilation, you can try modifying PC to be the same value as r14
![](/assets/crash_analysis_toolsbar_HR2.png)
### 4.2 Restoring LCPU Context

Restoring LCPU context is similar to HCPU, but first, you need to copy the required files (lcpu.axf and rom_axf files) to the script directory.

![](../../assets/add4.png)

The required file paths are as shown below, choose the correct `rom_axf` file for your model. The lcpu file depends on whether it was compiled with Keil or GCC.
#### Important Notes:
- LCPU files compiled with Keil have an `.axf` extension, while those compiled with GCC have an `.elf` extension. Make sure to distinguish between them.
- When choosing the `rom_axf` file, ensure you select the correct one based on the board model.

![](../../assets/add2.png)
![](../../assets/add3.png)

Next, open Trace32 and select the LA button. In the pop-up window, configure as shown below:

![Trace32 Configuration](../../assets/add1.png)

## 5. Common Trace32 Commands

In addition to the windows that are already opened, you can use the View menu to open new windows, as shown below:
- Registers: View the CPU registers.
- Dump: View data at a specific address.
- List Source: View the assembly code.
- Watch: View variables.

![View Menu in Trace32](../../assets/crash_analysis_cmd_view.png)

The variable window supports wildcards. For example, input `*error*rea*` and press Enter. It will suggest `error_reason`, which can then be selected and added to the watch window.

![Watch Window](../../assets/crash_analysis_cmd_watch.png)

![Watch Window 2](../../assets/crash_analysis_cmd_watch2.png)

You can also type commands in the command window below (commands are case-insensitive) to open debugging windows.

![Input Command in Trace32](../../assets/crash_analysis_cmd_input.png)

Examples:
- `V.W`: Open the watch window.
- `D.DUMP address`: View data at a specified address, for example, `D.DUMP 20000000` will show data starting at address `0x20000000`.
- `L address/symbol`: View assembly at a specified address, for example, `L 1011D888` will open the assembly window showing code starting at `0x1011D888`. `L rt_thread_stack_restore` will show the assembly code for the `rt_thread_stack_restore` function.

## 6. HEAP Analysis Example

The image below shows a scenario where heap memory leak is detected. The callstack window shows the function call stack for the assertion, and the heapAllocation window's system heap list shows the memory blocks allocated by `rt_malloc`. The `RETURN ADDR` shows the function name that called `rt_malloc`, and `TICK` shows the `rt_tick_get` time at the time of allocation.

![Heap Callstack](../../assets/crash_analysis_heap_callstack.png)

![Heap Detail](../../assets/crash_analysis_heap_detail.png)

The structure of a system heap memory management item is shown below. The first `uint16` is a special word `0x1EA0`, which is the value for all memory management items. If this value is not `0x1EA0`, the item has been illegally modified. The second `uint16` is a `used` flag: 1 means allocated, and 0 means not allocated. If values other than 0 or 1 appear, it indicates illegal modification, which could also lead to memory allocation failures.

![Heap Structure](../../assets/crash_analysis_heap_struct.png)

For example, in the HEAP window, the first row with an address of `0x200A27EC` shows a memory block allocated by the `rt_serial_open` function at the instruction address `0x1011B5FB`. The memory size allocated is 4108 bytes. According to the `struct heap_mem` structure, the system heap management item length is 28 bytes. Therefore, the memory address used by the caller is 28 bytes offset from the starting address of the memory block. 

In the example, the function `_lv_ll_ins_head` allocated 88 bytes of memory. The starting address of the memory block is `0x200B08E0`. In the variable view window, you can check this variable by using `(lv_obj_t*)(0x200B08E0+28)`. From the LVGL code, we can see that the size of `lv_obj_t` is 88 bytes (plus 8 bytes for the LVGL list link item after `lv_obj_t`). The function address `signal_cb` is shown in the command line window. You can enter the command `L 100DC9A1` to open the disassembly window and see the assembly code for that address, confirming the function is `lv_img_signal`, indicating that the `lv_img` control allocated the memory.

When memory leaks occur, you can use the allocation address and time to analyze where memory was allocated but not freed.
