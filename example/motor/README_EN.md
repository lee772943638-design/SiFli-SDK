# Motor Encoder Drive Example (RT-Thread)

[English](README_EN.md) | [中文](README.md)

Source path: example/motor

## Overview
This example demonstrates the complete flow to drive and control a pair of DC gear motors on RT-Thread. It includes:

- Reading motor speed/position using pulse encoders.
- Controlling motor duty cycle and direction using PWM outputs.
- Implementing PID control for speed and position loops (including an anti-windup variant).
- Providing a finsh Finsh command (`motor`) for real-time control and debugging.

### Brief on the PID algorithm
This example uses classic PID controllers for both the speed and position loops. The PID controller produces a control signal based on the error between the setpoint and the measured value to drive the PWM duty. The continuous-time PID expression is:

$$
u(t)=K_P e(t) + K_I \int_0^{t} e(\tau)\,d\tau + K_D \frac{d e(t)}{d t}
$$

where $e(t)=r(t)-y(t)$ is the error between setpoint $r(t)$ and process variable $y(t)$, and $K_P,K_I,K_D$ are the proportional, integral and derivative gains respectively.

In embedded sampled implementations, a discrete form is commonly used (with sampling period $T_s$ and sample index $k$):

$$
u[k]=K_P e[k] + K_I T_s \sum_{i=0}^{k} e[i] + K_D \frac{e[k]-e[k-1]}{T_s}
$$

or in recursive form:

$$
u[k]=K_P e[k] + I[k] + K_D \frac{e[k]-e[k-1]}{T_s},\qquad I[k]=I[k-1]+K_I T_s e[k]
$$

Anti-windup strategy: when the drive signal $u[k]$ exceeds the actuator limits (e.g. PWM duty range 0~100%), the output should be saturated and the integral accumulation stopped or adjusted to prevent further growth of the integral term which could cause overshoot. A common simple method is integral clamping:

1) Compute the unsaturated control (including all terms);
2) Clip the control to the allowed range;
3) If clipping occurred, do not update or conditionally update the integral term (only accumulate when not saturated or when the error direction helps reduce saturation).

Tuning tips: start with $K_I=0, K_D=0$ and increase $K_P$ until acceptable response speed; then add $K_I$ to eliminate steady-state error; finally tune $K_D$ to reduce overshoot and oscillation. Speed loop sampling is typically higher (tens to hundreds of Hz), while position loop sampling can be lower; the position loop usually acts as an outer loop around the speed loop.

### Quadrature encoder

This example uses incremental quadrature encoders (A/B two channels) for measuring motor speed and position. The encoder outputs two square waves approximately 90° out of phase; counters count A/B pulses to obtain incremental counts.

Wiring

- Use `ENC1A_PIN` / `ENC1B_PIN` for encoder 1 A/B channels; use `ENC2A_PIN` / `ENC2B_PIN` for encoder 2 (see the hardware connections table below).

Sampling window and counting

- The code reads and resets the encoder counters in the main loop at a fixed window (the main loop uses wake_time += 20), the window is about 20 ms (0.02 s).
- Therefore the input `pulse` to `pulse_to_rpm(int32_t pulse)` is the pulse increment measured during this 20 ms window.

Pulse to RPM conversion

- Convert pulses in the window to pulses per second: pulses_per_second = pulse / 0.02 = pulse * 50
- Convert pulses per second to rotational speed using pulses per revolution (PPR, accounting for encoder resolution, gearbox ratio and quadrature x4 counting):

  rpm = pulses_per_second / PPR * 60 = pulse * 50 / PPR * 60

- The inverse conversion (converting a target RPM to pulses within the time window, used for mapping) is:

  pulse = (int)(rpm / 60 * PPR / 50)

PPR origin

- In this example, total PPR is determined by three parts: encoder's PPR, gearbox ratio and quadrature x4 counting. The formula is:

  total_ppr = encoder_ppr * gearbox_ratio * 4

- With example hardware parameters: encoder_ppr = 13, gearbox_ratio = 20.409, we get:

  total_ppr = 13 * 20.409 * 4 = 1061.268

Example

- For a target speed of 120 rpm, the expected pulse count in a 20 ms window is:

  pulse ≈ 120 / 60 * 1061.268 / 50 ≈ 42

  If detected pulse = 42, then `pulse_to_rpm` yields:

  rpm ≈ 42 * 50 / 1061.268 * 60 ≈ 118.7 rpm

Notes

- Pulse direction: the code uses signed pulse values to represent direction (positive/negative). The command interface accepts a `dir` parameter to set the target direction (sign).
- Replace the PPR values according to your encoder and gearbox. For precision, consult the encoder datasheet or measure it practically.
- If the signal is noisy or bouncy, consider hardware filtering or software debouncing, moving average or low-pass filtering to improve speed calculation stability.

## Usage
After the program starts, control the motors via the serial console.
The finsh command format is: motor dir spd num
Parameters: direction, speed, number of rotations.
Direction (dir): 0 = forward, 1 = reverse
Speed (spd): in rpm (revolutions per minute)
Number of rotations (num): total rotations; set to 0 for continuous run
Examples:
- `motor 0 120 10` means forward, 120 rpm, 10 rotations
- `motor 1 180 12` means reverse, 180 rpm, 12 rotations

**Note**: adjust wiring and the pin macros in the code to match your actual hardware (for example, pin macros, PWM polarity, enable/direction mapping, power requirements, etc.).

**Note (configuration and migration guide)**: if you use different motor/driver models, check and modify the code following these points:

- Pins and macros: update the pin macros at the top of the file (e.g. `PWMA_PIN`, `PWMB_PIN`, `AIN1_PIN`, `AIN2_PIN`, `STBY_PIN`, `ENC1A_PIN`, `ENC1B_PIN`, `ENC2A_PIN`, `ENC2B_PIN`) to match your wiring.
- PWM polarity and frequency: some drivers require specific PWM polarity (active-high or active-low) or frequency. If the output direction is reversed from expected, invert duty logic or swap high/low mappings; adjust timer PWM frequency if needed.
- Enable/standby and direction signals: confirm the polarity (active-high/active-low) of the driver enable and direction signals. If different, invert the corresponding control logic or pin outputs in the driver code.
- Power and grounding: ensure motor/driver power can supply sufficient stall current and share ground with the MCU. Incorrect power or missing common ground may cause drive failures or incorrect encoder readings.
- Hall encoder interface: Hall sensors may need pull-ups or filtering; verify encoder supply and MCU logic levels (3.3V vs 5V); use level shifting or isolation if necessary.
- Protection and cooling: check driver current rating and heat dissipation; add heatsinks or current-limiting protection (fuses, current sensing) if needed.

Suggested modification order:
1) Update pin macros and build to confirm no syntax errors;
2) Validate PWM and direction logic with a simple single-direction short test;
3) Connect encoders and confirm pulse counting and direction;
4) Adjust PID parameters and verify closed-loop behavior at low speed.

## Troubleshooting

If the motor does not spin or the speed is abnormal, check the following:
1. Verify power connections, voltage and current meet the motor requirements.
2. Check motor wiring, especially PWM and direction control pins.
3. Confirm encoder wiring and that A/B channels are connected to the correct pins.

If the problem persists after these checks, please open an [issue](https://github.com/OpenSiFli/SiFli-SDK/issues) on GitHub.
