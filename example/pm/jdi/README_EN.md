# JDI Power Consumption Test Example

Source path: example/pm_jdi

### Supported Development Boards
This example can run on the following development boards:
- sf32lb52-core_n16r16

## Overview
After power-on, the screen is refreshed for 5 seconds before entering sleep mode. The system can be woken up by pressing Key1. After waking up, the JDI screen refreshes for another 5 seconds. Additionally, a timed wake-up is set to occur every 1 minute to refresh the screen once before entering sleep mode again. This tests power consumption in both sleep and wake states.

## Hardware Connections
During low power consumption testing, the board is no longer powered via USB but requires 5V power supply to the board's VCC_5V through a power consumption detection tool. Therefore, the following operations are needed to conduct power consumption testing.

### JDI Screen Pin Connection Configuration
| Pin | JDI Screen Adapter Board Pin | Adapter Board Physical Pin |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| PA2 | B2 | 8 |
| PA3 | B1 | 1 |
| PA4 | G1 | 18 |
| PA5 | R1 | 17 |
| PA6 | HST | 16 |
| PA7 | ENB | 14 |
| PA8 | VST | 5 |
| PA39 | VCK | 4 |
| PA40 | XRST | 2 |
| PA41 | HCK | 3 |
| PA42 | R2 | 12 |
| PA43 | G2 | 6 |
| PA24 | FRP | 15 |
| PA25 | XERP | 13 |
| PA24 | VCOM | 7 |

Note: The JDI screen adapter board's physical pin 25 needs to be connected to the development board's 3V3 to power the screen.

## Power Consumption Test Results
* Using a 200mAh battery capacity as an example, we tested under the above two modes to estimate the device's usable time.
* Classified into three scenarios: light usage, moderate usage, and heavy usage, corresponding to 100, 300, and 500 wake-ups respectively, with each wake-up performing 5 seconds of screen refresh operations.

### Wake-up Power Consumption
* Average current when woken up by key press and refreshing screen for 5s: 4.64mA
![alt text](assets/wakeup.png)

* Power consumption for one day of use
    100 times: 4.64 * 100 * 5 / 3600 = 0.64 (mAh)
    300 times: 4.64 * 300 * 5 / 3600 = 1.93 (mAh) 
    500 times: 4.64 * 500 * 5 / 3600 = 3.22 (mAh)

### Sleep Power Consumption
* Average current in sleep mode: 56uA
* Current breakdown
        - Chip module power consumption: ~50uA
        - Screen power consumption: ~7uA (VCOM, FRP need to output a 60Hz waveform)
![alt text](assets/enter_sleep.png)

* Power required for one hour of sleep
    56 / 1000 * 1 = 0.056 (mAh)

* Total daily consumption calculation:
    100 times: 0.056 * (24 * 3600 - 100 * 5) / 3600 + 0.64 = 1.98 (mAh)  
    300 times: 0.056 * (24 * 3600 - 300 * 5) / 3600 + 1.93 = 3.25 (mAh)
    500 times: 0.056 * (24 * 3600 - 500 * 5) / 3600 + 3.22 = 4.53 (mAh)

3. Data Summary
| | Wake-up Screen On | Screen Off Sleep | Daily Consumption | Usable Days |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|100 times/day|0.64mAh |1.34mAh |1.98mAh |101 days |
|300 times/day|1.93mAh |1.32mAh |3.25mAh |61.5 days |
|500 times/day|3.22mAh |1.31mAh |4.53mAh |44.1 days |

## Abnormal Diagnosis
If the measured results differ significantly from those in the document, there may be abnormalities that require troubleshooting.
VDDIO: Chip IO power supply
PVDD: Chip main power input
AVDD: Chip audio

1. Hardware modifications may cause significant deviations in test results
2. Power supply voltage mismatch with required voltage may also cause significant deviations in test results (5V power supply is used)
3. If the screen cannot refresh normally, check whether the pins on the screen adapter board are correctly connected to the board

* Troubleshooting steps: Remove the original 5V power supply and remove the jumper caps for VDDIO, PVDD, and AVDD. These three paths can be powered individually using the power consumption test tool, while the other two paths are powered through external VCC. This allows for individual power consumption testing to identify which power path has abnormalities (note that VCC_3V3 also needs to be powered separately as it powers the screen).
